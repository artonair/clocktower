<a href="http://www.schlingensief.com/index_eng.html">Christoph Schlingensief</a> is the inventor of a renowned and influential method of language apprehension, which he herein offers in a program intended specifically for American audiences. Founded upon a belief in the salience of learning a language from a native speaker, Schlingensief--who was himself a real German--brings his unique sympathy for the cause of continued American existence to his pedagogical approach. In this segment, Schlingensief begins with the basics of the salutation. Couching his lessons in an intensive methodology based on immersion, repetition and verbal games, Schlingensief provides American listeners with an instructive <i>and</i> fun way to learn this increasingly useful language (16 minutes).|*||*|1|*|100|*|0|*|154|*|2010-08-30 16:24:01|*|62|*||*|2010-10-22 11:31:33|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-08-30 16:00:53|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

<a href=”http://www.craigmorganteicher.com/”>Craig Teicher</a> is a poet, and someone who also writes fables.  Will has a bit of a problem with this as he is not a 75 year old blind Greek guy in a toga.  After Craig reads a few fables though, Will comes around.  Craig offers some insights into fables, some rather disturbing ones, like "Slow and steady wins the race" is a big lie.  Mostly, Craig says, fables are about how not to be a chump (31 minutes).|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|131|*|2010-09-03 15:17:19|*|62|*||*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|0|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-09-03 15:14:55|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

During his residency at the Clocktower Gallery in the summer of 2010 <a href="http://nonhorse.com">G Lucas Crane</a> compiled and surrendered these tapes to us which he described as "four tapes from the ongoing end of the world." He continues, "After the 3rd great storm each track was compiled from spherical open field microphones on a timer trip circuit. Dispersed into the population, lost, retrieved, and pieced together, they give an average sonic portrait of human movement during the several end-time cataclysms, fast and slow, that befell humanity." This project is made possible by a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts.

"The time for regret is past. Not for any reason other than all memories and trauma dim with age. Details get fuzzy. Places loose their names, concerns once felt so deeply seem trivial, and the plots of our former lives are gone. Something has changed, and to even try to recall the world insults its memory. Getting over the loss of the past leads to deciding it couldn’t have been all that great, that it does not deserve our respect, the life we lived before. It was cheap. It was shallow. We should let it go." -GLC (48 minutes)

"They’ve managed to get the electricity back on, finally. New people arrive every week. The radio station is open. Hydroponic Greenhouses sealed. Even discovered a hidden catch of un-damaged DVDs. A few classics. The meetings are going better and better, we’re getting things done. The mechanic finally has some help after that last ferry. Trips back into the city are well supervised. The annual dance and harvest fest is much appreciated. They haven’t returned with the truck, but their trip was known to be hard and long and they knew the risks. The school year starts again soon, the new north walls are almost finished. We are well defended, and suddenly not simply waiting for something to happen anymore." -GLC (46 minutes)

"This is the final development. Nothing at all actually happened. It was all in the mind. I fear It and think about it everyday, and was unconsciously enacting the rituals to bring it about. It was just ballooning internal paranoia heightening all worldly details against the individual and making it clear what must be done. The end is real
and near. Everyone else might not know, but I do. I know what happened, what is happening. That everything is different now. I get up from the computer and look out the window. In time they will know,
if they can tear themselves away from the daily rituals and diversions. I’ll talk them down, when its time. I’m not sure, but if everyone agrees to forget it makes the illusion permanent. Intelligent races will never reach a level of technology where they can run simulations of reality so detailed they can be mistaken for reality (assuming that this is possible in principle); OR Races who do reach such a sophisticated level do not tend to run such simulations; OR We are almost certainly living in such a simulation. So how seriously should we take this end?" -GLC (57 minutes)<br/>

Marja says: Cooking as a "language" is international (you don't have to speak the same language in order to produce results…) and writing about food offers equal opportunity to reach/influence a lot of people. Adolescent me was introduced to M.F.K. Fisher and immediately took to her writing like a fish to swimming. During summer vacation in France already discovered a delicious triple cream cheese, not realizing at the time it was named after that famous gourmand Brillat-Savarin who lived during the French revolution (and came to America for a visit). M.F.K Fischer's 1949 translation of his life's masterpiece became famous: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GYnZqBjBDHoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mfk+fisher+physiology&source=bl&ots=ZQpzDC3xS1&sig=z8FXnlYK1tncFMjyu-CQq6iCZ18&hl=en&ei=N8R_TPuZI4vLOP3FqJ0O&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false"><i>Physiology of Taste</i></a>. I'd read Alice B. Toklas back in Amsterdam, found her recipes inspiring. Not until I landed in New York did I read Julia Child, mostly watched her Sunday nights on television! Inspiring improvisational cooking… and that s what today's show is all about!

<b>THE SACRED AND THE PROFANE</b>: This week's schedule messes mightily with the gray area that separates the two. I mean, does there have to be a spot where you perceive the crossover? Frozen bodies recovered after decades, re-purposing a preacher's words (we have no less than two of these this week), culture born from oppression, a soundtrack for the apocalypse, ecstatic music made from insects and venom, and Matisse vs. Picasso. This gray area is good stuff.

One of the world’s premiere mountain climbers, Conrad Anker discovered British explorer George Mallory’s body, who died on Mount Everest in 1924, in 1999.  <a href="http://conradanker.com/"><i>The Wildest Dream: Conquest of Everest</i></a> blends documentary and drama to tell this story. Months after the discovery Ander's climbing partner Alex Lowe died in a avalanche in the Himalayas; Anker was three feet away and lucky to survive. He subsequently married Lowe’s widow and adopted their three sons. He then returned to Everest to see if he could determine whether Mallory might have actually made it to the summit, 31 years before Sir Edmund Hillary became “the first man” to complete the summit. In a wide ranging conversation Anker, 47, discusses his life, these climbs, and media coverage of his life and death sport (16 minutes).|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|11|*|2010-09-08 16:02:59|*|62|*||*|2010-10-22 11:15:02|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-09-08 16:01:37|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

(July 18 – October 11, 2010), John Elderfield, Chief Curator Emeritus of Painting and Sculpture, the Museum of Modern Art, who co-organized the exhibition with Stephanie D’Alessandro, Gary C. and Frances Comer, Curator of Modern Art at the Art Institute of Chicago, stopped by the Clocktower Gallery to talk with Brooklyn Rail publisher, Phong Bui, about the exhibit. An illustrated transcript of this conversation, which covers a lot of delicious historical context, can be found online at the <a href="http://www.brooklynrail.org/2010/09/art/john-elderfield-with-phong-bui">Brooklyn Rail website</a> (75 minutes).|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|130|*|2010-09-08 16:17:11|*|62|*||*|2010-10-22 11:20:34|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-09-08 16:15:49|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

Host Jeannie Hopper takes us on a journey into the life of Sister Gertrude Morgan (1900-1980), a preacher, musician, poet, and artist who resettled in New Orleans at the age of 39 to "carry God’s message to the headquarters of sin." In 2010 a renewed interest in her gospel infused album Let's Make a Record was fueled by a re-release and remix that involved <a href="http://www.ropeadope.com">Andy Blackman Hurwitz</a> of Rope a Dope Records , <a href="http://www.preservationhall.com">Ben Jaffe</a> of Preservation Hall and Producer/DJ <a href="http://www.fivesixmedia.com/">King Britt</a>. Hear them tell their story and her story and listen to the music on this special segment (30 minutes).
<br/><br/>
For more on <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/features/karlins/karlins4-9-04.asp">Sister Gertrude Morgan</a> including pictures we found some pretty fabulous stuff online. Polka dots, quilted texts, geometrics, odd portraits, wild patterns, and loud colors dominate... plus other entertaining and troubling stuff that seems to orbit the work of the self-taught outsider.

<b>ADULT SERVICES</b>: We could spin this faux redirect as being about the naughtier work of Carolee Schneemann (featured this week) and James Franco (his exhibit here is extended through October). There is also the simple truth that while we like to have fun and entertain there are many grown-up issues embedded in the arts. Hunt for the following in this week's schedule: separation of church and state, illegal immigration, art from the Middle East, the apocalypse, and a most compelling ethical conundrum, fake Chinese food.

For his third film, <i>Prince of Broadway</i>, NYU Film School grad <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048918/">Sean Baker</a>, who is known for his Comedy Central series <a href="http://www.gtheb.com/"><i>Greg the Bunny</i></a>, took his cues after observing immigrants selling knock-off merchandise on a strip of Broadway between Herald Square and Madison Park. He then fashioned a compelling, unsentimental story about Lucky, an illegal Ghanaian immigrant, and the toddler--suddenly handed to him by an ex-lover--who changes his life. Winner of the L.A. Film Festival’s Grand Jury prize and an Independent Spirit Award nominee for its John Cassavetes Award (16 minutes).

It's an AIR field trip up to lovely New Paltz, to the SUNY <a href="http://www.newpaltz.edu/museum/ ">Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art</a>.  Will sits down with the Museum Director Brian Wallis to discuss the <a href="http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/">Carolee Schneemann</a> exhibition <i>Within and Beyond the Premises</i>, (Feb-July 2010), and the innovative theory behind the museum's retrospective of her work, focusing on her entire career, early ties to abstract expressionism, and more recent work, rather than getting stuck on her more iconic work from the 60's and 70's. Wallis also talks at length about the museum's commitment to presenting major exhibitions of local artists. Luckily those local artists have so far been Judy Pfaff and Schneemann! (31 minutes)

In the first segment of a new series, New River spotlights poetry of four emerging women poets. They hail from the West, the Midwest, the East, and the Middle East; what they have in common is sensational talent and very different, startlingly original voices. 
<br/><br/>
Jeannine Hall Gailey’s first book of poetry, <i>Becoming the Villainess</i>, was published by Steel Toe Books in 2006. Poems from the book were featured on NPR’s <i>The Writer’s Almanac</i> and on <i>Verse Daily</i>; two were included in 2007’s <i>The Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror</i>. Her second book, <i>She Returns to the Floating World</i>, will be released in 2011 by Kitsune Books. Melissa  Range’s <i>Horse and Rider</i> won the Walt McDonald Prize, and is the recipient of a 2007 "Discovery"/<i>The Nation</i> Award and a 2006 Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers’ Award. Her poems have recently appeared or are forthcoming in <i>The Georgia Review</i>, <i>Image</i>, <i>The Paris Review</i>, and <i>Poetry London</i> (UK). Darcie Dennigan is currently writer-in-residence at UConn; she won the Poets Out Loud Prize for her poetry collection <i>Corinna A–Maying the Apocalypse</i>, published by Fordham University Press in 2008, and was also recipient of a 2007 "Discovery"/<i>The Nation</i> Award. Reena Ribalow, who lives in Jerusalem, has won a host of literary prizes including the Keats Poetry Prize, The Margaret Reid Poetry Prize, and The Golden Prize, as well as the Moment Magazine and the Stand Magazine Short Story Competitions. Her work has been published in <i>The Jerusalem Review</i>, <i>Ariel</i>, <i>The New York Quarterly</i>, <i> Shirim</i> and <i>The Literary Review</i>, among others. 
<br/><br/>
The poems are read by Patricia Randell, one of New York’s finest actresses, who has been hailed myriad times by reviewers – including on five occasions by <i>The New York Times</i> –  and who has been described with the phrase “there is no more authentic actress on the New York stage than she”; Lori Myers, who starred in the long-running hit NY production of <i>Our Town</i>, of whom <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine said “No one is more brilliant at conveying the layers of a character than Lori Myers”; and Randell Haynes, whose 25-year career spans theatre, television, and film, in regional theatres across America and in films such as <i>Glory</i>, <i>Radioland Murders</i>, and HBO’s <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i>.

In this edition submit yourself to a collection of sonic adventures featuring
Pharoah Sanders' ethereal chants, Jimmy Smith's electrified whirls of
the Leslie Organ, and DJ Logic's reimagining of Nina Simone's Obeah Woman.
Then we take a sonic shift into the worlds of contemporary composers. Shawn Lee blends rich ingredients and blurs borders. Wordsmith Emily XYZ addresses the unfortunately polarizing topic: Separation of Church and State. Berlin  based Nonine Records and Sonar Pilot Audio both journey into atmospheres underlined with <i>au courant</i> electronic beat programming. And the amazing Graham Haynes channels Miles Davis' Phantalassa vibe
using the technology of today, while clearly honoring what Miles pioneered in his analog
world. Lastly, enjoy the latest from Hess Is More off his latest ep
<i>Demoncrazy</i>.

<b>XENOPHONIA</b>: /xeno·pho·nia/ (-fo´ne-ah) by definition: an alteration in the quality of the voice. Some might say defect; others a blessing. When broadened to include the "artist's voice" the term begins to help us see the unification theory behind this week's schedule: French pastries on steroids, the sound of the Big Bang, a fully-formed Bronx accent, talking sense to the brainwashed, how not to blog, Barry Manilow in Afghanistan. So, try a new voice sometimes but be warned, as our mothers told us, it might stick.

On the occasion  of <i>George Kuchar: Always & Forever</i>, an exhibition of film, video, stills, drawings, paintings, and comics from the 60s to today at <a href="http://mulherinpollard.com/">Mulherin Pollard Gallery</a> in New York (through October 4, 2010) Will Corwin dialed up the artist and had a freewheeling phonecall covering facts and 
stories from his career. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0473647/">George Kuchar</a> and his twin brother <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0473648/">Mike</a> began making films in the Bronx and established themselves as working-class eccentrics with untrained actors and high-camp, gory, sexy, low budget brilliance. Filmmakers such as John Waters, Todd Solondz, and Martin Scorscese consider Kuchar a major influence on their work. As always, Will asks nit-picking questions about how the movies got made, with a few philosophical ones thrown in. Kuchar is a fabulous storyteller; his responses are off-beat and bizarrely literal at times.(29 minutes)

Pennebaker</a> (whose ‘60s classics include <i>Don’t Look Back</i>, featuring Bob Dylan, and <i>Monterey Pop</i>) and his wife <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0373698/">Chris Hegedus</a> (<i>The War Room</i>, <i>Startup.com</i>) have collaborated on <a href="http://phfilms.com/"><i>Kings of Pastry</i></a> a behind-the-scenes look at a world-famous but largely unknown French pastry competition where they were granted unprecedented access to the frenzied efforts of the 16 contestants. The duo discuss evolving definitions of the documentary form, the importance of access and trust in their work, and how they found the Chicago chef who is center stage here.(12 minutes)

Paris-based <a href=”http://www.artpapers.org/special_events/”>Laurent Grasso</a> was in New York for the opening of his exhibition <i>SoundFossil</i> at <a href="http://www.skny.com/gallery/">Sean Kelly Gallery</a> (through October 23, 2010) and visited the Clocktower for a sit down with host Michael Rush. Grasso likes to really mix it up in videos, sculptures, installations, many of which are inspired by obscure scientific research like the presence of sounds from the Big Bang found infossils. His show includes a neon eclipse, appropriated paintings with wonderfully bizarre additions,  and a video of a haunting trip through the woods complete with a horde of swarming bats. But it's the installation, the combination, and the conceptualization that fascinates both men here as they reach to explain and define the intangibles, perceptions, shifting elements in the work.

Dub is so comforting in times of war and strife (drawing in the Bob
Marley feelings of "everything is going to be alright"). Rhythm and
Culture presents the first release from Second Sky. Aram Scaram, the
host of a long standing Reggae radio show in Toronto, releases
Trouble under his moniker Citizen Sound. New York's Redbud Records
and Bastard Jazz always unearth hidden gems keeping vinyl alive.  Six
Degrees Records has a consistent release of world music fused with
electronics like <a href="www.myspace.com/gaudimusic">Gaudi</a>'s latest Brainwashed
and the awesome Bombay Dub Orchestra. 
<br/><br/>
Also, enjoy Agape featuring
<a href="www.myspace.com/agapefeaturingnadiaharris">Nadia Harris</a> out of Miami with
her dub band, Miguel Graca out of Montreal with his dubbed out talking
drum and <a href="http://www.fourtet.net">Four Tet</a>'s latest electronic 'ping
ponger'.

In this fifth edition of <i>Sonoridade</i>, producer Béco Dranoff presents a
broad overview on <b>Mangue Beat</b>, the influential cultural movement
that took the city of <b>Recife</b> (the capital of the northeastern state of
Pernambuco) by storm in the early 90's. Artists and bands such as
Chico Science & Nação Zumbí, Mundo Livre S/A, DJ Dolores, Otto and
many more, were the epicenter of  the most important music and art
movement since the Tropicália heyday in the late 60's. 
<br/><br/>
The Mangue scene released a <i>manifesto</i> introducing the unlikely concept of the
link between crabs (abundant in the swamps of this river/ocean city)
and the powerful satellite antennas delivering waves of international
pop culture. This highly original movement changed the face of
Brazilian pop music forever, bringing into the mainstream the fresh
mix of northern folk rhythms as Maracatú, Forró, Embolada, Côco,
religious chants with rock, dub, electronica, making it 'cool' for
kids to enjoy and explore Brazilian roots rhythms. Feel the <i>Mangue
Power</i>!!

<i>Dana Brett's Rack</i> by Jess Walter, read by Cotter Smith<br/>
<i>oldsmobile</i> by Clay McLeod Chapman, read by Guy Boyd
<br/><br/>
New River Fiction is proud to present two outstanding pieces of short fiction by two remarkable contemporary writers. <a href="http://www.jesswalter.com/">Jess Walter</a> is the author of five novels and one nonfiction book. His work has been translated into more than 20 languages and his essays, short fiction, criticism and journalism have been widely published, in <i>Details, Playboy, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe</i> and many others. His novel <i>THE ZERO</i> was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award, the 2007 PEN Center Literary Award and the 2007 LA Times Book Prize, and winner of the 2007 Pacific Northwest Booksellers Award. <i>Citizen Vince</i> was awarded the 2005 Edgar Allan Poe Award for best novel. <i>Dana Brett’s Rack</i> is a chapter from his novel <i>Land of the Blind</i>, and is read by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0807767/">Cotter Smith</a>, recipient of four Drama Logue Awards and two Ovation Award nominations, as well as the Broadway star of<i>Next Fall</i>, Wendy Wasserstein's <i>An American Daughter</i>, Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize winning <i>How I Learned to Drive, Burn This</i>, Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prize winning <i>A Soldier’s Play</i> with Denzel Washington and Samuel Jackson, and many others. Television and film work ranges from his debut 25 years ago as Robert Kennedy  in the mini-series <i>Blood Feud</i>, to his role as the President of the United States in the film, <i>X2: X-Men United</i>.  He recently appeared on Barry Levinson’s HBO film <i>You Don’t Know Jack</i> with Al Pacino.  
<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.pumpkinpieshow.com/">Clay McLeod Chapman</a> is the author of <i>rest area</i>, a collection of short stories, and <i>miss corpus</i>, a novel. Tom Robbins, author of <i>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues</i> and <i>Jitterbug Perfume</i>, said of Chapman’s work, “Like a demonic angel on a skateboard, like a resurrected Artaud on methadrine, like a tattletale psychiatrist turned rodeo clown, Clay McLeod Chapman races back and forth along the serrated edges of everyday American madness, objectively recording each whimper of anguish, each whisper of skewed desire.” In <i>The Village Voice</i>, Alexis Soloski wrote “If Clay McLeod Chapman keeps up with the oddball characters, well-crafted stories, and critical plaudits, that Faulkner guy better watch out." Clay’s piece <i>oldsmobile</i> is read by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101777/">Guy Boyd</a>, a renowned supporting actor who won the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion Award for Best Actor for his role in Robert Altman's <i>Streamers</i> (1983). He may be best remembered for his performance as Detective McLean in Brian De Palma's <i>Body Double</i> (1984). Most recently, he was seen co-starring on the science fiction television series <i>Black Scorpion</i> and appearing on Broadway in the Tony-winning drama <i>August Osage County</i>.

<a href="http://taylordeupree.com">Taylor Deupree</a> has been making arrestingly beautiful electronic music for over fifteen years. With his beginnings in dance-oriented techno,
Deupree now produces a brand of ambient, electro-acoustic composition with a focus on minimalism and micro-sounds.  He speaks with host Elliot Stapleton about his first synthesizer, the acclaimed <a href="http://www.12k.com/">12K</a> record label he founded, and about how he's moving further and further away from electronics altogether.

<b>THE GOLDILOCKS ZONE</b>: This is what astronomers call the sweet spots in the universe that could sustain water and life. Just right. Scientists recently announced that they found a planet hanging around in such conditions. Sweet spots do make life nice. Rooms have sweet spots. You know the best place to get a nice sound on your guitar or to get comfy and write your story. Apparently baseball bats have sweet spots; that's how you hit the ball farthest. Hearts have sweet spots, though that's a bit more metaphysical than astrophysical. But our favorite sweet spot is where you move the antennae just right and discover a fabulous new radio station. Although it might be too hot for Goldilocks.

<b>LOUD NEIGHBOR</b>: We have opened up one of our project rooms for a thing called Giant Noise Toy. It was built here at the Clocktower Gallery by a group called Loud Objects. They are: an architect, an indie video game guru (check out Baby Castles!), and a composer who uses science and math. The Toy is an eight-foot high toggle switch attached to a mischievious microchip. Kind of Claes Oldenburg meets David Tudor. Come flip the switch and hear the indescribable result. Our gallery visiting info appears elsewhere on this homepage. The Toy may be loud but we hope it also waters our plants when we are on vacation.

On 30 July 2010 the <a href="http://www.serpentinegallery.org">Serpentine Gallery</a> Pavilion in London staged <i>Sleepover</i>, an overnight event of talks, films, experiments and a midnight feast plus a series of Insomnia Labs featuring talks, workshops, lectures and discussions on professional insomniacs, the night, dreaming, sleep, and the productivity of sleeplessness. Artists, architects, and musicians hosted activities throughout the night, exploring ideas of mapping sleep and the psychedelic qualities of insomnia. This segment documents one event from that night, <i>Lullaby</i>, a performance by artist/musician <a href="http://www.daleisloup.com">Dale Berning</a>. (24 minutes)

The curator of the Guggenheim Museum's 2010 blockbuster <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/chaos-and-classicism"><i>Chaos and Classicism</i></a> (through January 9, 2011) stops by the Clocktower to tell the story of the exhibition.  It's a match made in heaven because Will is fascinated by fascism and it's manipulation of various media for control purposes, and that's pretty much what <i>Chaos and Classicism</i> is about. Ken talks serious curation, setting the parameters of the show, gathering the art together; what pieces to ask for, which ones to leave alone: the exhibition features work by Matisse, Picasso, and Leger among others. Apparently, all listeners should run out and watch Peter Cohen’s 1989 documentary called <a href="http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/34/architecture.php"><i>Architecture of Doom</i></a>. (33 minutes)

In an epic performance that spans decades and nearly six hours, Venezuela’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1183149/">Edgar Ramirez</a> charts the rise and fall of <a href="http://www.sundancechannel.com/carlos/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=carlos%20edgar%20ramirez&utm_campaign=miniseries"><i>Carlos</i></a> (Ilich Ramirez Sanchez), the notorious terrorist of the ‘70s and ‘80s in Olivier Assayas’s insightful, fast-paced drama. Shot digitally and shown on TV in its miniseries form and in a 150-minute theatrical version, Carlos prompted Ramirez to gain 35 pounds, speak five languages, and work virtually nonstop for months.  The result is a performance that has been compared to Brando at his peak. (29 minutes)

Host Pete McCabe talks with Aldo Perez and Jenny Lee Mitchell, founders of <a href="http://www.theaterthe.com">Theater The</a>, a downtown performance art and music ensemble in New York. They discuss their 2010 full-length production of <i>Radio Purgatory</i> (at <a href="http://www.dixonplace.org/">Dixon Place</a> through October and November), their absurdist philosophy and Film Noir aesthetics, play some of their mash-up musical sample pieces, and bring in the full troupe to perform music from their show; described as Kurt Weill on acid. Hear more about this project, more music, and more hijinx from a <a href="http://www.artonair.org/archives/j/content/view/3236/">2009 Theater The session</a> in our studios. (39 minutes)

In this segment AIR's Jeannie Hopper discusses photojournalism and
activism with <a href=”http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty.aspx?id=48689”>Michelle Bogre</a>, Associate Professor in the School of Art, Media and Society at Parsons The New School. Michelle's finishing up a book (late 2010 release) on the topic and seeks to motivate students to use the medium to expose issues and bringing about change. <a href=”http://www.torgovnik.com/”>Jonathan Torgovnik</a>, photojournalist and activist, exemplifies such an effort. Michelle found Jonathan through <a href=”http://mediastorm.com/ “>mediastorm.com</a> and a story he did on Rwandan rape victims who became pregnant and then chose to give birth. He was inspired to create <a href=”http://www.FoundationRwanda.org”>Foundation Rwanda</a> to provide education, support, and awareness for mothers and children of the genocide era. In Part 2 we go deeper into Jonathan's ongoing work and the progress of his foundation.

Constructing histories and obstructing understanding fascinates artist <a href="http://www.skny.com/artists/laurent-grasso/">Laurent Grasso</a> who discusses all this in a lecture at the School of Visual Arts from September 2010 (with comments by curator Béatrice Gross). To explain himself he solicits the concepts of memory, silence, scale, displacement, military ingenuity, and an eclipse made out of neon. Grasso visited New York during the run of his 2010 exhibition at Sean Kelly Gallery entitled SoundFossil (through October 23). See our companion in-studio interview with host Michael Rush <a href="http://www.artonair.org/archives/j/component/option,com_alphacontent/section,97/cat,48/Itemid,187/">here</a>. (34 minutes)

Long mixes that take you on a journey. This is the theme of this edition of In the Hopper. Recently, Jeannie was invited to spin for <a href="http://www.deepspacenyc.com/index.php">Deep Space</a> which is where the journey begins (including the roller coaster dub ride of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/scotthardkiss">Scott Hardkiss</a>' <i>You & I</i>).  Romain's latest, <i>Ocean 13 House Anthem</i>, has DJ's scrambling to figure out when he's going to let it out for greater consumption and on which of his labels?  <a href="http://www.gkfrecords.it/">Gotta Keep Faith Records</a> is fast becoming a favorite with quality releases ranging from Disco-infused to spectacular vocal tracks. Enjoy the latest greatest dance tunes; keeps the Hopper mighty happy to share these gems with you!

This track went viral in the summer of 2010. Simple formulation of slowing a pop song down with pitch correction. It is often compared to Sigur Rós or Enya but take our word, it's is more in the league of Billy Basinski or Terry Riley. Built by Tampa-based musician Nick Pittsinger (who operates as  <a href= "http://shamantis.bandcamp.com/">Shamantis</a>) using the  "time-stretching" program PaulStretch.

AIR's Jeannie Hopper invites Grammy Nominated international recording artists <a hfref="http://www.LesNubians.com"><i>Les Nubians</i></a> to the studios. They're about to complete their latest tour, with the finale scheduled in New York this Friday, October 15th, 7 pm at <a href="http://www.lepoissonrouge.com">Le Poisson Rouge</a>. <br/><br/>

Can't make it to Le Poisson Rouge on Friday?  Don't fret--more performance dates are in the works as Les Nubians gear up for the release of their latest album, "Nu Revolution," in 2011. Currently available as a tease to the full-length release is a live "Nu Revolution" ep.  Les Nubians' sister duo Hélène Faussart and Célia Faussart grace us with a performance live in our recording studio, accompanied by a few of their fellow band mates--Alexis Juliard on vocals, Masa Shimizu on guitar, and Shaun Kelly on percussion.  "Music is every moment of our lives," Hélène declares in Les Nubians' press release.  Indeed, this is exemplified throughout the interview and performance here at the Clocktower.

Didn't make it to Le Poisson Rouge on Friday?  Don't fret--more performance dates are in the works as Les Nubians gear up for the release of their latest album, <i>Nu Revolution</i>, in 2011. Currently available as a tease to the full-length release is a live <i>Nu Revolution</i> ep.  Les Nubians' sister duo Hélène Faussart and Célia Faussart grace us with a performance live in our recording studio, accompanied by a few of their fellow band mates--Alexis Juliard on vocals, Masa Shimizu on guitar, and Shaun Kelly on percussion.  "Music is every moment of our lives," Hélène declares in Les Nubians' press release.  Indeed, this is exemplified throughout the interview and performance here at the Clocktower.

Matthew Wells, a native of the Boston area, moved to New York to become a famous writer, and like so many other people in the arts, has been working desk jobs in large corporate offices ever since. He is the author of over 20 plays, whose subjects range from subatomic physics (<i>Schrödinger’s Girlfriend</i>, performed at the Magic Theatre in 2001) to literary history (<i>Oscar and Adonis</i>, which won the Tennessee Williams Literary Festival Playwriting Award in 2000) to noir thriller (<i>Scarlet Woman</i>, which will be performed as part of the 2011 Frigid Festival in New York). In this segment Wells reads <a href="http://matthewslikelystory.blogspot.com/2010/09/manhattan-sonnets-14-21.html"><i>The Manhattan Sonnets</i></a> which he began in response to an e-mail from a close friend in Australia, which read:  "Subject: Challenge.  A sonnet to restore one's faith in New York City: harsh and tender, terrible and lovely. We fight, but I love her." There are now over 30 of them. (18 minutes)

The notorious outing of CIA operative <b>Valerie Plame</b> remains a black mark on the G.W. Bush Administration’s legacy and <a href="http://www.fairgame-movie.com/"><i>Fair Game</i></a> examines the woman, the politics, her marriage (<b>Sean Penn</b> plays her heroic husband, retired U.S. Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV) and the fallout. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0510731/">Doug Liman</a>, the <i>Bourne Identity</i> director (whose father prosecuted the Iran-Contra affair), talks of making a nonpartisan account of this disgraceful episode in Washington affairs. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915208/">Naomi Watts</a> speaks of what she took from Plame to play her.

By using common materials and objects that are readily available in local hardware and grocery stores for each of her site-specific installations, <a href="http://www.sarahsze.com/">Sarah Sze</a>’s negotiation with her own sense of scale and each given space has become increasingly urgent in recent years. However monumental her large forms, the intense networks of minute details found in her work announce their presence just as forcefully.
<br/><br/>
In this conversation Sze discusses at length the evolution of her growth as an artist, from her undergraduate experience at Yale University (1987-1991) and her four year break from school (1991-1995) during which she spent a year in Japan studying <a href="http://www.ikebanahq.org/"><i>Ikebana</i></a> and then directed a branch of <a href="http://www.breakthroughcollaborative.org/learn/about">Breakthrough</a>, an educational nonprofit for low income public school students, to her graduate studies at New York’s School of Visual Arts.  Each of these chapters goaded the development of her mature “style” without “Style.” (64 minutes)
<br/><br/>
Sarah Sze's installation at <a href="http://www.tanyabonakdargallery.com/">Tanya Bonakdar Gallery</a> (September 16–October 23, 2010) is also the topic of Sze’s visit to the Clocktower Gallery and its Art International Radio studios. A <a href="http://www.brooklynrail.org/2010/10/art/phong-bui-with-sarah-sze
">transcription</a> of this conversation was published in the <i>Brooklyn Rail</i> both online and for its October 2010 issue.

Artist <a href="http://www.leeboroson.com/art/">Lee Boroson</a> converted a rather derelict space into a studio in Williamsburg many years ago, with artists Eve Sussman and Simon Lee.  When that got too expensive he moved with those two artists to another space, also in Williamsburg. These tales add to our growing archive on the history of Williamsburg art scene.  Lee also talks about his Spring 2010 exhibition <i>Universal Solvent</i> at the Sara Meltzer gallery in New York’s Chelsea district. <i>Boroson’s work is characterized by a fascination for natural phenomenon, from galactic fireballs to earth-bound wind and water vortexes.</i>--from his website.

Experimental Composers: <b>Charlemagne Palestine</b>, Holy 1 & Holy 2</b><br/>

Composer John Duncan plays bits of both and hosts this segment in our Experimental Composers archive section.<br/>

<br/><br/>
Holy 1 and Holy 2 were both created and recorded by <a href="http://www.charlemagnepalestine.org/Charlemagne_Palestine/Charlemagne_Palestine_official_site.html">Charlemagne Palestine</a> in NYC in 1967 by building up a texture, oscillator by oscillator, then adding tiny increments of white noise that would "gradually make the sounds thicker and thicker until they were immense sacred machines humming like gargantuan Tibetan bees." This is the track for the first 35 minutes or so of this program. 
<br /><br />
In 1969 the Free Music Store of radio station WBAI asked Palestine to create a piece for an event they were preparing to broadcast live on radio. This is the second part of this show and features Tony Conrad on his Long String Drone, saxophonist Bob Feldman on chimes and a conch, soprano Deborah Glaser, and Palestine on another homemade instrument called the Alumonium. The piece became Alloy and the sound used as the electronic background continuum, played through loudspeakers in the hall, was Holy1&2. Our thanks to segment producer, John Duncan. (59 minutes)

<b>LBJ, IRT, USA, LSD, FBI, CIA</b>: When intoned with a little lilt, this strophe-like sequence of characters became an iconic chant embedded in one of the great American cultural landmarks, the musical <i>Hair</i>. Politics and culture emerged as our unifying theme in this week’s stream, with a little sideshow on psychedelia, and this tune popped back into consciousness. Or was it a flashback? Anyway, the Internet is the new acid. Or is it the new reality? Final word of advice: Buckle your seatbelt Dorothy because Kansas is going bye-bye.

From a 1966 Pixie Records release by Dr. Timothy Leary, the man who coined the phrase, "Turn on, tune in, drop out", who was called "the most dangerous man in America" by Richard Nixon, and who remains controversial to this day including amongst the counterculture (he died in 1996). Here he outlines chapter and verse of his LSD gospel. (30 minutes)

Editor's note: We normally avoid linking to Wikipedia on the subjects we broadcast but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary">Leary page</a> is pretty impressive. A good start.

As the starting bell for the fall 2010 season sounded, host Zefrey Throwell happened to swing by a delightfully mischievous show at <a href="http://www.antonkerngallery.com/index.php">Anton Kern Gallery</a>, and who should be showing but the talented, the unholy, the pithy, the nimble Scot himself….  <a href="http://www.davidshrigley.com/">David Shrigley</a>. From mounted crooked fingers on the wall, to a robot bludgeoning a baby seal, to a long plinth of huge ceramic black boots, Shrigley's fourth show with Kern is a winner (through Oct. 30, 2010). Listen along as they suss out such heated topics as yoga balls, saddle chairs, hating children (except for one lucky child, Linus), how to get a gallery in NYC and of course no interview is complete without an in-depth investigation of the deadly Glasgow Smile. (34 minutes)

Host Pete McCabe of HERE Arts Center talks with the very charming <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/communication_and_me/faculty/meir_ribalow_29438.asp">Meir Ribalow</a> about his Artistic Directorship of <a href="http://www.newriverdramatists.org/">New River Dramatists</a>, his playwriting, prose fiction, and his multi-faceted career. He also talks about his philosophy of writing and teaching, explaining how he is more interested in the talent of individual writers, not necessarily what kind of plays they write. Ribalow curates and produces the New River segments for ARTonAIR.org.
<br/><br/>
M.Z. Ribalow is an internationally acclaimed Renaissance writer of all forms: from poetry to screenplays, song lyrics to children's books. His plays have been produced in London, Paris, and Amsterdam, and have traversed to the remoter corners of the globe--even to Canada. In addition to a prolific creative writing career, Meir contributes articles to several well-known periodicals providing critique on film, theatre, and music. He has directed numerous plays, and has served as the Artistic Director of the American Repertory Company and the Production Associate at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Meir attended Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton University, and is currently Artist-in-Residence at Fordham University.  (30 minutes)

Brisbane, Austrialia's <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/search/tag_results/tag/lawrence+english">Lawrence English</a> stopped by the Clocktower studio while on a brief tour throughout America.  Lawrence is a composer, producer, curator, label-head of <a href="http://www.room40.org/">Room40</a> records, and a well-known globe-trotter.  He was kind enough to revel host Elliot Stapleton with stories of traveling around the world for unique field recordings that included hydrophonic atmospheres from Stradbroke Island, famous winds of the world, and an attempt to record silence in Antarctica.

Our Jeannie Hopper sat down with the Austrian dub remix masters <a href="http://www.kruderdorfmeister.com/">Peter Kruder and Richard Dorfmeister</a> in New York after a nine year absence. They catch us up on their label <a href="http://www.g-stoned.com/">G-Stone</a> now celebrating its 16-year anniversary with a collection featuring 13 new tracks and 12 classics. The two also operate individual projects as Peace Orchestra and Tosca. They have also grown to fully embraced a synched video and music visual show with Fritz Fitzke and MC's in the mix.  (Note that at the time of this posting in October 2010 the duos websites are being rebuilt so don’t trash that link!).  (16 minutes)

Will Goes on location to interview <a href="http://www.simonlee.org/">Simon Lee</a> in his studio in the sky. Simon who, with wife Eve Sussman and friend Lee Boroson, struck out into the Wilds of Williamsburg oh-so-many-many years ago. Simon talks a bit about the effect of poetry on his career (certain books that just won't go away) and when an artist is at the right point to interpret another artist's work. Simon's most recent project, with composer <a href="http://www.algiskizys.com/">Algis Antanas Kizys</a>, is <i>Where is the Black Beast?</i>, which uses Ted Hughes' 1970 volume <i>Crow</i> as a jumping off point. Plus an awesome story about actually living in Socrates Sculpture Park, and not as an art work, ala Ward Shelley. See also our the companion interviews with Boroson, Sussman, Shelley, and other Williamsburg artists in the ARTonAIR.org archive.

The show runs the gamut from the electronic Forró beats created by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djlkuk">DJ LK</a>'s remix of a <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mestresdaguitarrada">Guitarrada</a> song to Rio's <a href="http://www.myspace.com/maryabravo">Marya Bravo</a>'s remake of the classic <i>Fala</i> by 70s psychedelic eccentrics <a href="http://www.myspace.com/secosemolhados">Secos & Molhados</a>. The show also makes pit stops in Salvador (BaianaSystema, Recife, Momobjó, São Paulo) with the samba-rock-blues of the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/garotassuecas">Garotas Suecas</a> and lands in Lisbon with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cacique 97">Caçique 97</a>'s amazing Afrobeat cover of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jorgebenjor">Jorge Ben Jor</a>'s <i>Jorge De Capadócia</i>.

During Will's efforts to get an oral history of the Willamsburg art scene, 

everyone urged him to interview <a 

href="http://www.brucepearsonstudio.com/">Bruce Pearson</a>, a key 

figure in the community, but every time Will ran into him Pearson would 

recommend other people to interview first! Now we've got him on the 

record. His colorful text-based bas-reliefs crafted out of high density 

foam have graced the cover of <i>Art In America</i> and the walls of 

the Ronald Feldman gallery for years. He also asked to make this 

interview a bit of an experiment. While the two talked, <i>La légende 

d'Eer</i> of Yannis Xenakis was playing simultaneously (though they could 

not hear it). Bruce talks about his early punk days in California, his 

lifelong dedication to the music scene, and even a project with our own 

David Weinstein, producing a heterodyne effect in a Brooklyn grain silo 

using Jim Jones's maniacal laughter. (33 minutes)|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|131|*|2010-10-28 15:29:05|*|62|*||*|2010-10-29 15:11:19|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-10-28 15:27:33|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

Our Jeannie Hopper welcomes members of the Italian psychedelic 

soundtrack and neo-funk band <a 

href="http://www.calibro35.com/">Calibro 35</a> as they introduce themselves to 

American audiences on a 2010 tour. More John Barry (James Bond 007) than Ennio Morricone (Good, Bad & Ugly), the 

music is deliciously arranged for classic pop instrumentation with an ear for 

details of the 70s.
<br/><br/>

<a href="http://www.myspace.com/toomi">Tommaso Colliva</a>, a music 

producer for the bands Franz Ferdinand and Muse and sound engineer, 

used to collect soundtracks as a kid.  When he decided to merge his 

creative juices with a jam band formed by <a 

href="http://www.myspace.com/massimomartellotta">Massimo 

Martellotta</a>, the result was Calibro 35--the Milanese music 

group that draws much of their inspiration from 70s Italian cop and 

thriller movies with distinctive soundtracks.  Luca Cavina is on bass 

for the band, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fabiorondanini">Fabio 

Rondanini</a> is on drums.  <a 

href="http://www.enricogabrielli.com/">Enrico Gabrielli</a> plays 

keyboard, flute, and saxophone for the band.  He is also a composer and 

has played on the instrumentals on several tracks for Muse.  Massimo 

Martellotta is the band's guitarist, though he is known for his

A talk by <a href="http://www.queensmuseum.org/">Queens Museum of 

Art</a> director Tom Finkelpearl on the subject of <i>Survival 

Strategies for the Recession-Weary Museum Leader</i> given in an 

address to the Directors Forum of the <a 

href="http://www.thedirectorsforum.org/">Art Museum Partnership</a> on 

October 24, 2010 at the National Arts Club in Manhattan. This 

conference attracts curators and directors of non-profit museums from 

across the country for a few days each year to talk and tour, wine and 

dine, and schmooze and share. John Nichols, Executive Director of the 

Art Museum Partnership, introduces Mr. Finkelpearl. Staff diversity, 

risk-taking, community engagement, collections, website strategies, 

board development, and commitment to complex art are all discussed in 

this thoughtful, sometimes irreverent, thoroughly relevent, and 

compelling tale of a career, a museum, and a community. (46 minutes)|*||*|1|*|98|*|0|*|32|*|2010-10-28 16:29:49|*|62|*||*|2010-10-29 15:01:05|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-10-28 16:27:26|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0192845/">John Curran</a>, whose new movie <a href="http://www.stonemovie.com/stone.html"><i>Stone</i></a> pairs Robert De Niro and Edward Norton for the second time, is a director who, says Norton, his friend and two-time leading man, continually examines authenticity in his films. <i>The Painted Veil</i> was a remarkably astute adaptation of the Somerset Maugham story of infidelity and forgiveness between a married couple (Norton and Naomi Watts) in 1920s China. <i>Stone</i>, which was adapted from a play and filmed around Detroit, considers a parole officer (De Niro) and a convict named Stone (Norton) and the “war” they engage in while sitting in chairs on opposite sides of a desk as one man crumbles and the other finds peace.

<b>NATHAN SALSBURG, WILL YOU MARRY ME?</b> (That is, if Béco says no.) But we get ahead of ourselves. You see, for the past weeks our crew (engineers, researchers, programmers, copywriters) have been laboring to restore Nathan's 2006 radio program called <a href="http://www.artonair.org/archives/j/component/option,com_alphacontent/section,101/cat,159/Itemid,187/"><i>Goodbye Dear Old Stepstone</i></a> to the Internet. This week we uploaded nine segments of blues, hymns, ballads, and other extreme folk music and fell in love all over again. This complicated our crush on Béco Dranoff, who keeps stealing hearts with the most criminally seductive sets of Brazilian music ever to spill into the stream (you see we can't help ourselves!). Anyway until we hear something from one of you we are going to continue to see other people specially since the Italians from Calibro 35 were hanging out at the Clocktower this week (close your eyes and visualize Henry Mancini in furry handcuffs...)

<b>DEEP IMPACT AND THE SPACE PEANUT</b> Our obsession with outer space continues. A vehicle named Voyager was launched in 1977 carrying (oy) a gold-plated phonograph record (!) containing sounds and images selected to "portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth." It has since passed through our solar system and will encounter another in 40,000 years. If the recipients have a turntable will they hear art talk from Sweden, The Philippines, England, Canada, and Brazil plus music from Southeast Asia mixed with music by Jack White, Natalie Cole and Robert Moog? Well, guess what planet that is on. Who's the peanut now?

Brazil born, New York City based photographer and artist <a href="http://www.vikmuniz.net/">Vik Muniz</a> wanted to give something back to those who struggle as he did, rising from the lower economic rung. What he encountered and what happened--as documented in <a href="http://www.wastelandmovie.com/"><i>Waste Land</i></a> by director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1013671/">Lucy Walker</a>--was, without exaggeration, life changing. This is true for for Muniz as well as the junk pickers and recyclers he photographed for <i>Portraits in Garbage</i>, his transformational, large-scale pictorial series. As Walker explains, “When people tell me they cried during the movie, I say, 'Who didn’t cry?'"  The award winning film festival favorite takes the most unlikely of subjects to make one of the year’s most memorable documents. (44 minutes)
<br/><br/>
Note: Vik Muniz gave an inspiring presentation about this project during the 2009 Creative Time Summit: Revolutions in Public Practice in a session called Alternative Economies that we recorded and keep on the <a href="http://www.artonair.org/archives/j/content/view/2905/">Creative Time page</a> in our archive.|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|11|*|2010-11-04 16:54:44|*|62|*||*|2010-11-18 10:33:13|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-11-04 16:45:42|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

The Editor-in-Chief of <a href="http://www.artpapers.org/"><i>Art Papers</i></a> comes to the Clocktower 

to explain exactly what <i>Art Papers</i>' mission is, and there's a lot 

more history to this art magazine than one might suspect, with it's 

dead-pan title and serious demeanor.  Founded initially as a newsletter 

for the Atlanta Art Workers Coalition, it was meant to be a grass-roots 

broadside developed to inform and help artists in the Atlanta area. 

Since those humble beginnings, one could argue it has become the leading 

intellectual magazine devoted to promoting art from all sectors of the 

USA and the world--with a focus on not-for-profit and artist-run spaces. 

In the November 2010 issue our Clocktower Gallery is the subject of a cover story 
featuring James Franco in conversation with AIR's Alanna Heiss and Will Corwin.|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|131|*|2010-11-04 16:59:41|*|62|*||*|2010-11-08 06:49:43|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-11-04 16:57:05|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

In this segment, Leeza Ahmady talks with <a href="http://www.globalartmuseum.de/site/person/141">Patrick Flores</a>, one of the most active curators working in Southeast Asia today, just after completion of his four-month research grant from the Asian Cultural Council to study the modern-to-contemporary shift in American Museums.  The conversation, held at They cover a  range of issues on the topic of Southeast Asian Art, recorded at <a href="http://www.trfineart.com/">Tyler Rollins Fine Art</a> in New York City in October 2010 covers a brief history of modern and contemporary art in Southeast Asia, from the cultural programs of Imelda Marcos to the recent flourish of the “artist-curator.”  Flores discusses his views on the influence (and sometimes lack thereof) of Western Art History on the region and the current challenges faced by SE Asian artists and curators in trying to assimilate into the larger international art community.  His unique insights into the various art scenes in this part of the world build a strong case for Southeast Asia’s importance as a hub for new ideas and a force to be reckoned with as contemporary art shifts from a regional to an international discourse. (41 minutes)

With the micro-budgeted semi-autobiographical <a href="http://www.tinyfurniture.com/">Tiny Furniture</a>, writer/filmmaker <a href="http://www.lenadunham.com/">Lena Dunham</a> has solved the problem of what comes after graduating from Oberlin College:  Do more screenwriting, acting and producing.  Dunham wrote, starred, and directed <i>Furniture</i>, which she filmed in her parents’ Tribeca loft with her mother and sister among the cast in a story that with wry humor and self-deprecation considers a new grad’s prospects with jobs, men, friends and family. Coming soon: An adaptation for megaproducer Scott Rudin and for HBO: a 21st century style <i>Sex and the City</i> as Dunham devises, produces, writes and stars in a series about three girlfriends in contemporary Manhattan.

Will´s great-grandad was a master steam-fitter at the Oak Ridge Uranium refining plant, and Leslie´s pop was a much-higher-up as a nuclear scientist. Much of Leslie´s work addresses the issues of post-apocalypticism, in large part due to having to contend with them on a very near and dear level. And you will hear the description of her father, Slim Pickens style, riding the bomb. Yes, for real.

Tom Robbins, author of <i>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues</i> and <i>Jitterbug Perfume</i>, said of Chapman’s work, “Like a demonic angel on a skateboard, like a resurrected Artaud on methadrine, like a tattletale psychiatrist turned rodeo clown, Clay McLeod Chapman races back and forth along the serrated edges of everyday American madness, objectively recording each whimper of anguish, each whisper of skewed desire.” In <i>The Village Voice</i>, Alexis Soloski wrote "If Clay McLeod Chapman keeps up with the oddball characters, well-crafted stories, and critical plaudits, that Faulkner guy better watch out." <i>early release</i> is from his full-length show Commencement. 
<br/><br/>

<i>It's not just the food, it's the bringing of the food.</i><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--Dalai Lama, attributed
<br/><br/>
This started me thinking about where we receive our first food<br/>
& quickly: mother, breast & mother's voice came to mind.<br/>
Then: traditions in celebrating new life.<br/>
Remembered:<br/>
Dutch home ritual of <i>Kandeel</i><br/>
a drink served when visitors come to visit a new baby.  <br/>
(<i>Kaneel</i> is Dutch word for cinnamon) <br/>
It is a fortifying drink made with egg yolk,white wine & cinnamon...<br/>
Served in a whimsical glass with a spoon...<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--Marja Samsom<br/>

<b>BIOGRAPHY ROCKS </b>: Oscar Wilde said, "Biography lends to death a new terror" and perhaps if you are the impending subject, yes. For the rest of us, how delicious. Some obscure favorites: the composer George Antheil (The Bad Boy of Music) an avant-gardist who, with actress Hedy Lamarr, patented a torpedo guidance system during WWII. Or Moe Berg, the professional baseball player (Chicago White Sox) and U.S. spy who surveilled Tokyo for bombing targets. This week our radio streamcast and new programs bring you a series of biographical investigations, conversations, and artworks. This includes, to continue the WWII subtheme, a guy who rode the atomic bomb for real.

Performance art historian and native South African RoseLee Goldberg introduces this PERFORMA-sponsored discussion with panelists <a href="http://www.sfai.edu/People/Person.aspx?id=1336&sectionID=2&navID=365">Okwui Enwezor</a> and <a href="http://admin.tisch.nyu.edu/object/WillisD.html">Deborah Willis</a>.  In the past ten years, increasing attention has been given to African contemporary art and, as Goldberg points out, performance is a uniquely important art form because of its physicality, cultural description, and interdisciplinary approach toward creative expression.  The panel discusses topics ranging from exploring the intersection of masculinity, the body and the body politic in performance; how fashion, beauty, narrative storytelling, and blackness can be performed through creating an experience of looking; to how even personal style can be a strikingly performative act, as is the case with the <a href="http://www.africafeed.com/post/73905767/the-sapeurs-of-congo-open-gutters-and-gucci-loafers">sapeurs</a> of the Congo (whose fashion would make any Bourdieu scholar's mouth drop). (52 minutes)

For more than twenty years <a href="http://jamescasebere.net/">James Casebere</a> has been at the forefront of an international movement in photography that questions the truthfulness of any image and the potential unreliability of what we think we see. Casebere discusses his meticulous methods of constructing fictional scenes in his studio then photographing them for exhibition. His haunting work embraces cinema, surrealism, social systems, urban sprawl and a broad sweep of history. His 2010 show at <a href="http://www.skny.com/">Sean Kelly Gallery</a> (through December 4) received glowing notices such as this one from critic <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/arts/design/12galleries.html">Roberta Smith</a> of the <i>New York Times</i>.

A remake of one of Korea’s most famous films, Kim Ki-young’s 1960 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150980/"><i>The Housemaid</i></a>, director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0407992/">Im Sang-soo</a>’s 2010 Cannes selection and <a href="http://twitchfilm.com/news/2010/04/cannes-2010-extended-trailer-for-im-sang-soos-the-housemaid-looks-like-koreas-best-of-the-year.php">  same-titled version</a> differs in several details, primarily in no longer making the young housemaid who is hired in an upper middle class household an evil seductress. The director of Korean hits like <i>The President’s Last Bang</i> (2005) and <i>A Good Lawyer’s Wife</i> (2003) tells us that his next film will feature a male protagonist - and a murder.

Having gone to Cooper Union where he had studied with Angelo Ippolitto and Nicolas Marsicano, among other known artists and teachers of the New York School (1961-1967), <a href="http://bombsite.com/issues/65/articles/2171">Thomas Nozkowski</a> perceptively adapted their improvisational approaches and embarked on a long journey to allow his art to evolve and come into natural fruition without haste and vexation of spirit. In this segment he talks about his experience of working as an art installer at the legendary Betty Parsons Gallery, his friendship with the artist Ruth Vollmer, and other issues concerning the decades-long process that led to his identifiable styles and late recognition. Nozkowski also speaks about what lies behinds the works in his second solo exhibit (October 22 – December 4, 2010) at <a href="http://thepacegallery.com/">Pace Gallery</a>.

Composer <a href="http://stevenmackey.com/">Steven Mackey</a> brings his music to the Clocktower, en route to a rehearsal with the Ensemble ACJW at Julliard. Mackey is known for merging, bridging, or gently refusing to observe the gaps between various musical genres, most notably in works for electric guitar with classical ensembles. His work has been performed by world class ensembles such as the Kronos String Quartet and he has composed music for Bill Frisell, Joey Baron, the Paul Dresher Ensemble, and the L.A. Symphony Orchestra among many, many others. Mackey talks about playing electric guitar in rock bands in college and how his natural inclination to try new things lead him into uncharted territory.

<b>FORBIDDEN FRUITS & PLANETS, COINCIDENCE OR CONSPIRACY?:</b> This week we honor those who dare to cross into dangerous territory... and triumph. Some are artists who mix disciplines, some are characters in stories, some are bold students of the language. It's certainly in our artist DNA to peek where we are told not to peek or speak what some dare not speak. Technology going backwards? Humor in terrorism? DJs in the concert hall? Yes, we are trying to make you nervous. Is that art?

Actor <a href="http://www.kirasternbach.com/">Kira Sternbach</a> reads <i>People Who Can’t</i>, a 2010 story by author <a href="http://www.glenhirshberg.com/">Glen Hirshberg</a>. (25 minutes)

<br/><br/>
Glen Hirshberg‘s new novel, <i>The Book of Bunk: A Fairy Tale of the Federal Writers’ Project</i> (Earthling, 2010), has been hailed by Lucius Shepard as "a miracle of narrative diversity and drive...It's as if Woody Guthrie and Gabriel Garcia Marquez had co-authored a 90,000-word folk song." Glen’s previous novel, <i>The Snowman's Children</i>, received rave reviews from <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, and many others. Each of his acclaimed story collections, <i>American Morons</i> and <i>The Two Sams</i>, received the International Horror Guild Award and was selected by Locus as a best book of the year. He won the 2008 Shirley Jackson Award for his novella, <i>The Janus Tree</i>. <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> calls him "the author of stories that are as unsettling as they are scary, as disturbing as they are profound...Literary, chilling, the next big thing", and Peter Straub describes him as "A writer to watch, and to treasure." He co-founded the Rolling Darkness Revue, a traveling ghost story performance troupe, and he teaches writing at Cal State San Bernardino.

Brian Dewan visits the Clocktower armed with a 

fantastic selection of music played on some pretty 

wonderful and strange instruments. Brian and his 

cousin Leon are the creators of the <a 

href="http://www.dewanatron.com/">Dewanatron</a>, a 

family of electronic synthesizers/controllers, which 

are also half art-piece. They have been featured at 

Pierogi Gallery, The Armory Show, P.S.1 and elsewhere. 

Dewan has also performed using musical rocks, and the 

bells of the Liverpool Cathedral, all while on a 

residency in the north of England. And he's a 

Williamsburg artist who does faux-educational 

slide-film projections-recently featured at L.A.'s 

Museum of Jurassic Technology. (46 minutes)|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|131|*|2010-11-18 15:09:18|*|62|*||*|2010-11-27 11:28:42|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-11-18 15:07:52|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

Host Jeannie Hopper leads a round table discussion with artists and educators <a href="http://melaniecrean.com/newmc/">Melanie Crean</a>, <a href="http://www.artslant.com/ny/artists/show/159801-azin-feizabadi">Azin Feizabadi</a>, <a href="http://www.worldofawe.net/">Yael Kanarek</a>, and <a href="http://www.huongngo.com/">Huang Ngo</a> about the 2010 exhibition <a href="http://shapeofchange.com/blog/"><i>How To Do Things With Words</i></a> at Parsons's Sheila C. Johnson Design Center.  Melanie Crean, who organized this exhibition including the work of fifteen artists and collectives, describes the show as the curating of a series of "radical speech acts."  Many of the works reenact or re-stage speech as a means for looking at how it is learned, reinterpreted, and transformed through space, time, and context.<br /><br />

Huong Ngo describes the performance she made with artist Hong-An Truong that reenacts a naturalization test (rigorous; also includes a hefty oath of citizenship for those who are lucky enough to successfully complete it), and explains her involvement with the Cross Wire Collective.  Yael Kanarek discusses her performance piece "Trigger Words," in which performers are asked to create a multi-lingual list of words that make them feel nervous to be performed out loud.  Azin Feizabadi reads from the script of his film <i>The Interpretation</i>, a film that overlaps poetic analogies of the children's game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29">Mafia</a> (including God as one of the players) with responses from Iranians on their feelings about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Movement">the Green Movement</a> in the 2009 Iranian election.

Host Jeannie Hopper sits down with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fourtetkieranhebden">Kieran Hebden</a>, who is truly a Renaissance musician--don't be "freaked out" if his next album is solo opera singing.  This is the sort of creative freedom 33-year-old Hebden demands, and the result is that his work has had the space to evolve and change freely, drawing musical influences from almost everywhere we at AIR can think of--late 60s early 70s jazz, hip-hop, London electronica, techno, Senegalese music, folk, improvisation, to working in a sound studio in his computer.

<br/><br/>
Hebden tells Jeannie about the beginnings of his career performing with the British post-rock band Fridge
in 1997 before going solo under the artist name <a
href="fourtet.net">Four Tet</a> with <a
href="dominorecordco.us">Domino Records</a> in 1998.  As Four Tet,
Hebden has put out seven records, working digitally and almost
exclusively on his computer since 2003, making remixes and abstract
electronic music.
<br/><br/>
Much changed in 2005 as Hebden was thinking more and more about the
possibilities of live electronic improvisation.  He was paired up with
legendary drummer Steve Reid, who jammed with Miles Davis back in the
day.  Reid at the time was engaged in experimental, "full on sonic
assault" drumming paired with spoken word.  Somehow magic happened
within the first three minutes of their sound check together at their,
and Reid and Hebden commenced on what would be a five year
collaboration until Reid's passing in 2010, creating some of
the most innovative music pairing Reid's background improvising with
seminal jazz artists together with Hebden's passion for unconventional
electronic improvisation. 
<br/><br/>
Hebden was in town for a show at New York's Webster Hall during CMJ promoting his 2010 record <i>There Is Love In You</i>; he also landed at the Moog Festival in Ashville, NC.

Composer <a href="http://stevenmackey.com/">Steven Mackey</a> brings his music to the Clocktower, en route to a rehearsal with the Ensemble ACJW at Julliard. Mackey is known for merging, bridging, or gently refusing to observe the gaps between various musical genres, most notably in works for electric guitar with classical ensembles. His work has been performed by world class ensembles such as the Kronos String Quartet and he has composed music for Bill Frisell, Joey Baron, the Paul Dresher Ensemble, and the L.A. Symphony Orchestra among many, many others. Mackey talks about playing electric guitar in rock bands in college and how his natural inclination to try new things lead him into uncharted territory.

<b>SAVE ALLEN GINSBERG!</b> We are raising funds to digitize and preserve dozens of deteriorating recordings made by legendary radio producer and scholar Charles Ruas. In collaboration with archives and libraries and, with Ruas' counsel, we are finding incredible stuff from Burroughs and Borges to Williams and Wilson. Visit our <a href="http://www.artonair.org/archives/j/content/view/2112/200/">Contribute</a> page to support this effort.
<br/><br/>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, NOVEMBER 2010</b>
<br/><br/>

(November 24, 2010) AIR, Art International Radio and the Clocktower Gallery are proud to announce that the Historic Archives of Charles Ruas--hundreds of recordings of key literary and artistic figures--will be preserved and made available free to the public through AIR’s online radio station and cultural archive, ARTonAIR.org.  
<br/><br/>
Since the early 1970s Charles Ruas has been a central figure in the American cultural landscape as the inaugural Director of the Drama and Literature Department at WBAI-FM New York City and the former host and producer of the influential radio programs <i>Conversations with Writers</i> with guests including Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs,  <i>Audio Experimental Theater</i> with performers including Meredith Monk and Yvonne Rainer, <i>Dial a Poem</i> with poets including Jack Spicer and Gary Snyder, and <i>The Words of Our Fathers</i>, an oral history radio program with Studs Terkel, just to name a few. However, the majority of these recordings have deteriorated over time on their original cassette and reel-to-reel tapes, and now require emergency intervention or they will be lost forever.
<br/><br/>
Through agreements with Charles Ruas, the Pacifica Radio Archives, Columbia University, and Yale University where these artifacts are stored, AIR will oversee the digital preservation and cataloging of over three hundred of these rare and remarkable radio programs. The restored shows will be universally accessible online through AIR’s cultural archive at ARTonAIR.org.
<br/><br/>
The AIR Board of Directors and generous donors have made this initiative possible. The public is invited to participate in the fundraising campaign online. A $30 donation secures the preservation of a single historic program. Visit the Contribute page for details.
<br/><br/>
About Charles Ruas: Born in Tientsin, China, Ruas is an American author and scholar, legendary friend and interviewer of artists of all stripes, literary and art critic, and translator. A graduate of Princeton University (MA 1963, PhD 1970), Ruas was a Fulbright Scholar at the Sorbonne (1963–64). He is a specialist in French, English, and Comparative Literature, which he has taught at universities in the United States, France, and China.

href="http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2010/11/lanzmann

-shoah-film-jews"><i>Shoah</i></a> celebrates its 25th 

anniversary with a re-release intended to honor the 

French filmmaker's commitment to remembering the awful 

annihilation of six million Jews under Nazi rule.  A 

vigorous age 85, Lanzmann--in this interview that is 

primarily in English with occasional French--reflects on 

the innate inability to name what happened and how he 

uses no historical footage but rather visits the sites 

where so many were murdered and interviews survivors and 

participants. Lanzmann tells how <i>Shoah</i> was chosen 

as his title and became a byword for the events.  

Candidly and devastatingly he summarily rejects the 

subsequent deluge of Holocaust films, including Steven 

Spielberg's Oscar winning <i>Schindler's List</i>, and 

why he believes Spielberg's well-intentioned Shoah 

Foundation is pointless. (32 minutes)|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|11|*|2010-12-02 15:05:18|*|62|*||*|2010-12-10 15:43:37|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-12-02 15:04:20|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

In this two part interview with sculptor Joel Shapiro 

and gallerist Jonathan Levine, host Jill Spalding also takes 

a look at what’s up at 2010 Art Basel Miami Beach. (34 minutes)
<br/><br/>

<a 

href="http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/11/art/joel-shapi

ro-with-phong-bui">Joel Shapiro</a>’s prolific career as 

a sculptor is almost as bounteous as strollers in Park 

Slope, with his total of roughly 130 exhibitions (one of 

his earliest was in AIR’s very own Clocktower Gallery). 

Spalding and he discuss his sculpture showing in Miami, 

made out of wood cast in bronze, plus work beyond the 

2010 show. Spalding’s questions are the questions we’ve 

all been wondering about Shapiro’s work: Why no titles 

for the pieces? Why wood? And what’s with the influx of 

color in the recent work? Shapiro also discusses his 

airborne sculptures, and the 2001-A-Space-Odyssey-esque 

inspiration for them (he was interested in throwing wood 

up in the air in the 80s…).

About">gallerist</a> and curator <a 

href="http://www.jonathanlevinegallery.com/?method=home.

Jonathan">Jonathan Levine</a> has managed to create a 

space in the art world where less-mainstream artists can 

show their work—specifically the spray painting, punk 

and hip hop, skateboarding, Star Wars-watching rebels 

inspired by current popular culture.  First opening a 

gallery in 2001 in New Hope PA, then moving to 

Philadelphia several years later, only to move his 

gallery to Chelsea in 2005, Levine has managed to 

establish a space for his artists’s work front and 

center while at the same time maintaining their 

anti-establishment spirit.  Spalding and he discuss his 

involvement with the 2010 Art Basel—how much can he and 

Tony Goldman can do with free reign on two walls?—and 

his thoughts on corporate sponsorships, Shepard Fairey’s 

move to working with Deitch, and what Levine’s plans are 

for future projects.|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|39|*|2010-12-02 15:13:55|*|62|*||*|2010-12-03 15:39:04|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2010-12-02 15:11:30|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

Hungarian government to create what emerged as a 

monumental piece to be installed at the <b>Hungarian

<b>JIM MORRISON EXONERATED!</b> The Doors frontman was pardoned last week from a conviction for allegedly exposing himself onstage in Florida in 1969. Thank you, he's been dead for 39 years. His bandmates say eyewitnesses were the subjects of mass hypnosis. This story lead us to an in-office survey of what great performers we have seen who are no longer "operational." The tally was impressive and includes Miles Davis, John Cage, Frank Sinatra, Larry Levan, James Brown, Pina Bausch, Eartha Kitt, Marcel Marceau, Johnny Cash, Dennis Hopper, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Robert Moog, the Sex Pistols, and Elvis. We've impressed ourselves.

This edition of <b><span style="color:#FF31FF;">BLURRING</span><span style="color:#FF8100;">radio</span></b> features a veritable smorgasbord of electronic music (which, 

contrary to stereotype, is not all post-90s or dance).  The mix opens with <a 

href="http://www.whitehinterland.com/">White Hinterland's</a> Icarus who, in Greek mythology, 

adorns the wings that his craftsman-father Daedalus constructed out of wax and feathers. <br /><br />


This mix from host DJ DB plays with craft and influence in electronic music, and many of these 

musicians have taken a cue from their predecessors—some might say even that the music of 

<i>Kraftwerk</i> informs the minimalist structure and electronic sound of the Four Tet remix of <a 

href="http://www.bttls.com/">Battles</a>'s Tonto, or <a 

href="http://lcdsoundsystem.com/main/">LCD Soundsystem</a>'s You Wanted A Hit.  Pop's sound makes its way into many tracks on the list, including 

I Can't Help Myself by <a href="http://www.weareenfantterrible.com/">We Are Enfant Terrible</a>, 

and Tell Me Stories by <a href="http://www.thekickdrums.com/">The Kickdrums</a>.  <a 

href="http://vipercreekclub.com/">Viper Creek Club</a> 

use the structure of the pop song when composing many of their songs, including Glow.  <a 

href="http://www.time4planb.co.uk/us/">Plan B</a> give new life to the sound of R&B, and <a 

href="http://www.myspace.com/thebabeinthewoods">Washed Out</a>’s New Theory, released on the 2009 

album Summer, sounds like that sexed-up number from your 80s prom dreams. And is it possible that the <a href="http://www.rollingstones.com/"> Rolling Stones </a>’s song 

Slave, <a href="http://www.arcadefire.com/">Arcade Fire</a>’s Modern Man, and even Icarus 

are Thoreauvian commentary on the electronic condition?<br /><br />

Ellen Weisbrod and Melissa Powell, director and producer of the Film, <a href="http://www.awomanlikethatfilm.com/"><i>A Woman Like That</i></a>, stop by the Clocktower to tell the story of their feature-length documentary. The film follows the life of the renaissance artist <a href="http://www.artemisia-gentileschi.com/index.shtml">Artemesia Gentilesschi</a>, but it does more than that. In researching and talking about Artemesia, director Weisbrod, who also narrates and appears in the film, finds a source of inspiration and strength in the paintings of this painter who had been often misunderstood. In the telling of the story she gathers together art historians and art lovers who have been touched by a woman who succeeded against many obstacles in a time when women were not supposed to be painters to begin with, and certainly not supposed to paint the way Artemesia did.

Denmark’s most acclaimed and celebrated contemporary actress <a href="http://paprikasteenofficial.com/">Paprika Steen</a> is virtually unknown here. That could change with her <i>tour de force</i> in <a href="http://applausemovie.com/"><i>Applause</i></a> as a recovering alcoholic actress who--as she stars onstage in <i>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i>--tries to stay on the wagon, bond with her two young sons, and find serenity. Steen, whose mother was American, speaks of how the film and her role as Thea was fashioned, the role her real life husband and son play in <i>Applause</i>, and reflects on a career that saw her become famous as a satirical comedienne, segue to a Dogma veteran, to now become a fearless dramatic actor.
