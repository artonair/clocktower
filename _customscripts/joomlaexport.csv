David Weinstein hosts composer <a href="http://www.repple.se/datacide/">Elliott Sharp</a> in a whirlwind tour of his late 2010 releases and the stories that orbit them. <i>Spectropia Suite</i> (NEOS) features The Sirius String Quartet and singer Debbie Harry in a soundtrack to the sci-fi movie directed by <a href="http://tonidove.com/">Toni Dove</a>. In <i>Binibon</i> (HENCEFORTH) Sharp's fifth opera, the composer displays all his performing tools including guitars, saxophones, bass, synthesizers, clarinets, percussion, drum and sample programming. With a libretto by <a href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/w/jack-womack/">Jack Womack</a>, it documents East Village culture of the early 80s including drugs, murder, and music. The third project is <i>Reflexions</i> (IDIOLECT) a series of duo improvisations with koto player <a href="http://www.japanimprov.com/myagi/index.html">Michiyo Yagi</a>. Recorded in 2005, it has finally been released.

One of the world’s most honored auteurs, Mexico’s <a 

href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0327944/bio">Alejandro 

Gonzalez Inarritu</a> describes himself as a "neurotic 

perfectionist" who will do 100 takes of the simplest scene to 

achieve its meaning. For his fourth film and for the first time 

since his breakthrough hit <i>Amores Perros</i>, Inarritu returns 

to a fully Spanish language drama.  Written expressly for Javier 

Bardem and, most unusual, filmed chronologically in sequence for 

18 weeks, <a 

href="http://www.biutiful-themovie.com"><i>Biutiful</i></a> is set 

in Spain with Bardem terminally ill.  A man who can communicate 

with the dead, his troubled ex-wife is bipolar and abuses their 

son. His job leads to the murder of 25 illegal aliens, including 

women and children. It is, Inarritu explains, a classical tragedy, 

one very different from his <i>21 Grams</i> and <i>Babel</i>. (19 minutes)|*||*|1|*|97|*|0|*|11|*|2011-01-07 12:55:33|*|62|*||*|2011-01-07 15:13:35|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2011-01-07 12:54:35|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=

<b>EXCLUSIVE AND RECLUSIVE:</b> Artists and celebrities conspire to hide from us. Whether for self-preservation or marketing is a case by case determination.  Andy Warhol and Bob Dylan come to mind as two masters of the form.  As cultural journalists, and freaky fans, we endeavor to get you past those velvet ropes. This week we have succeeded mightily.  Artist David Hockney, composer Elliott Sharp, DJ producer Scott Hardkiss, a Butoh artist whose website is a blank white screen, and some musicians and game artists whose site is just the opposite: a maddening screen jumble of floating icons that propagate on every click. And then there's Marcel Duchamp, who may just be the exception that proves the rule. All in this week's stream.

From a series of broadcasts and vinyl releases from the 

mid-seventies, American poet and performance artist <a href="http://brainwashed.com/giorno/">John Giorno</a> 

muses with co-producers and interviewers Charles Ruas and Linda 

Perry over the pragmatic-yet-existential dilemmas faced by poets 

(a poem just doesn’t sell like a painting), and also tells why he 

hasn’t read any poetry lately and why he’s friends more with 

artists than with poets.
<br/><br/>
Giorno has compiled a playlist of poems from a varied and radical 

group of poets: <b>Edwin Denby</b> (reading <i>The Shoulder</i>, <i>Over 

Manhattan Island</i>, <i>Disorder Mental Strikes Me</i>, and 

<i>Suppose There's a Cranky Woman Inside Me</i>), <b>Helen Adam</b> 

(reading <i>Cheerless Junky Song</i>), <b>Diane DiPrima</b> (reading 

<i>Ave</i>), <b>John Cage</b> (reading <i>Moreau</i>), <b>Denise Levertov</b> 

(reading <i>Life at War</i>), <b>Kenneth Koch</b> (reading 

<i>Spring</i>), <b>John Ashbery</b> (reading <i>A Blessing in 

Disguise</i>), and <b>Charles Stein</b> reading one of his <i>Seed 

Poems</i>.
<br/><br/>
These poets riff off of everything and anything from the Vietnam War to New York City; prayer as poetic form to tongue twister as poetic form; poem as irreverent mini-musical to poem as word-music; writing on the quotidian to writing a poem that resists discussion.

<a href="http://www.theislandarts.org">The Island</a> presents Studio Dispatches, a radio broadcast series with 

contributions by over 40 artists currently (2010) based in the UK, produced by Andrew Bonacina and Victoria Brooks. 
The artists each created five-minute "dispatches" from their 

studios to reflect what they were working on at that moment. In the 

resulting broadcasts the artists' thoughts, interests and topics 

of research take various forms, from spoken word or music to 

collaged sound. 
<br/><br/>
Part 1: <a href="http://www.gilesround.co.uk/">Giles Round</a>, <i>Time Just Falls Away</i>; <a href="http://www.tomwoolner.com/">Tom Woolner</a>, <i>A Dispatch for Radio in 2 Parts</i>; <a href="http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/linder/">Linder</a>, <i>Darktown Cakewalk</i>; <a href="http://www.canadianart.ca/online/reviews/2010/05/13/corin-sworn/">Corin Sworn</a>, <i>Untitled</i>; <a href="http://www.shezaddawood.com/">Shezad Dawood</a>, excerpt from <i>For a Few Rupees More</i>
<br/><br/>
Originally conceived as a five-hour analogue broadcast for Radio 
IPS, which temporarily transformed the gallery at <a href="http://www.internationalprojectspace.org">International 
Project Space</a> in Birmingham into a broadcasting studio, The Island 
Studio Dispatches mirrored this transition of the closed space of 
production into the public context of the gallery by inviting the
artists to create audio transmissions from their places of work. 
Studio Dispatches questions the notion of the studio, a concept 
fractured by increasing physical, conceptual and technological 
mobility.|*||*|1|*|100|*|0|*|155|*|2011-01-13 11:29:58|*|62|*||*|2011-01-14 15:22:09|*|65|*|0|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*|2011-01-13 11:28:18|*|0000-00-00 00:00:00|*||*||*|pageclass_sfx=
