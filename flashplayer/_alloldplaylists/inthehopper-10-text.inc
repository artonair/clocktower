In this edition submit yourself to a collection of sonic adventures featuring Pharoah Sanders' ethereal chants, Jimmy Smith's electrified whirls of the Leslie Organ, and DJ Logic's reimagining of Nina Simone's Obeah Woman. Then we take a sonic shift into the worlds of contemporary composers. Shawn Lee blends rich ingredients and blurs borders. Wordsmith Emily XYZ addresses the unfortunately polarizing topic: Separation of Church and State. Berlin based Nonine Records and Sonar Pilot Audio both journey into atmospheres underlined with <i>au courant</i> electronic beat programming. And the amazing Graham Haynes channels Miles Davis' Phantalassa vibe using the technology of today, while clearly honoring what Miles pioneered in his analog world. Lastly, enjoy the latest from Hess Is More off his latest ep <i>Demoncrazy</i>.
