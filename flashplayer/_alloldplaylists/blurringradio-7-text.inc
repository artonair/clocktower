The ghostly visage of Jack White and the synthpop spirit of Bernard Sumner haunt DB's seventh BLURRINGradio mix, with tunes by The White Stripes  playing alongside Stripes forerunners Led Zeppelin and Stripes prot&#233;g&#233; Arctic Monkeys, and Sumner's New Order colliding with the its own echo in the songs of The Blac  and The Whip. This is a self-reflexive playlist: one song ends and, before you can get its sound out of your head, there it is again, coming out of the reverentially inventive minds of the next band.
