Sonoridade: Musica Moderna #3<br />
For the November 2010 edition of Sonoridade, host and producer Béco Dranoff selects recent gems from Brazil's cutting edge and most innovative artists, producers, and DJs. The show runs the gamut from the electronic Forró beats created by DJ LK's remix of a Guitarrada song to Rio's Marya Bravo's remake of the classic Fala by 70s psychedelic eccentrics Secos & Molhados. The show also makes pit stops in Salvador (BaianaSystema, Recife, Momobjó, São Paulo) with the samba-rock-blues of the Garotas Suecas and lands in Lisbon with Caçique 97's amazing Afrobeat cover of Jorge Ben Jor's Jorge De Capadócia. Put on your seat belts and welcome to the tropical sound blender. Enjoy!
