For the fourth edition of <i>Sonoridade</i>, host Béco Dranoff selects classics by Novos Baianos, the seminal musical collective that was almost impossibly prolific: from their foundation in Salvador in 1969 to their dissolution in 1978, the band released eight records. More impressive than the extent of their output is its breadth and depth: they fused for the first time such musical styles as samba, rock, tropicália, chorinho, bossa nova, psychedelia, MPB and more.
