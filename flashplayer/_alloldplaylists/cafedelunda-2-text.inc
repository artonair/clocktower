<i>Indigenous Worlds</i>: <b>Cafe Del Unda</b>, Asian Blend<br />
Host and record bin diver Sean Carter begins his survey of Southeast Asia with a set of obscure treasures and guilty pleasures ranging from traditional folk to sino-pseudomuzak to sixties pop and seventies fuzz discovered in his years of living in and traveling about the region. This is the kind of stuff you know is out there in the dusty corners of the world, but it takes a real explorer to find it. If you love this segment let us know, and we'll encourage Sean to do this regularly!
