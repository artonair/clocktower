Sound and Vision: Dana Schutz<br />
It's easy to imagine a playlist by <a href="http://www.zachfeuer.com/danaschutz.html">Dana Shutz</a> as a soundtrack to her paintings. Stories and imagined possibilities are articulated with great quantities of oddness and voice. Tracks from David Thomas and Two Pale Boys, Delta 5, Bobby Gentry, PJ Harvey, others.
