The Jam is on one end of this latest mix by DB, while the solo work of Jam front-man Paul Weller is on the other; everything in between was recorded at some point between The Jam's first album and Weller's most recent. It should come as little surprise, then, that, whether the other groups lean more toward the luminaries' New Wave tendencies, their post-punk experimentations, their pop rock glories or just their general sense of musical wanderlust, the ghost of the mod revivalists looms as a dancing influence throughout.
