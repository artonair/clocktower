Sound and Vision: Marc Handelman<br />
<a href="http://www.sikkemajenkinsco.com/marchandelman.html">Marc Handelman's</a> playlist (like his paintings) is infused with a subtle spectrum of negative radiance. But don't be surprised if the dark turns out to be light (or visa versa). With tracks from Public Enemy, M.I.A., Stars of the Lid, Frederic Chopin, Richard Wagner, others.
