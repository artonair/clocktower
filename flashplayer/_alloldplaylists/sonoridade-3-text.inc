For the third installment of his monthly Sonoridade program, B&#233;co Dranoff presents another show from the <i>M&#250;sica Moderna</i> series. B&#233;co unearths the best and most forward-thinking sounds and grooves by young Brazilian musicians, picking up tunes from his travels to such usual cultural suspects as S&#227;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro alongside other musical enclaves from all around the country and even, in an unusual jag outside of Brazil, passing through the far-away Netherlands.
